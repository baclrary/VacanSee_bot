fix: if lang already chosen there's error


future:

fix:
scraper, so it scrapes for new vacancies to db and gives users back some of these vacancies based on their configs.


scraper:
1. I have scraper separately, that collects vacancies to DB
2. I have notificator, that attaches these new vacancies to appropriate users' configurations and notifies them about it.
